        <p>Oceana Canada seeks to make our oceans as rich, healthy and abundant as they once were.</p>
        <p>Oceana Canada was established as an independent charity in 2015 and is part of the largest international advocacy group dedicated solely to ocean conservation. Canada has the world’s longest coastline in the world, with an ocean surface of 7.1 million square kilometres, or 70 per cent of its landmass. We believe that Canada has a national and global obligation to manage our natural resources responsibly and help ensure a sustainable source of protein for the world’s growing population.</p>
